<h1>The best movies of all time according to Sergi F Mascaro</h1>
<h2>Top three movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Mask</h3>
<p>This movie actor Jim Carry, an introvert banker that does not have 
the guts to get what he wishes for encounters a misterious mask, 
which when he wears it he becomes this crazy fun filled being with super powers.</p>
<h3>Trueman Show</h3>
Again Jim Carry is Andy Trueman, in which was the first movie before the crazy boom of big brother. 
Andy lives in a world where everyone is  an actory and everywhere is a movie set but he is the 
only one that does not know this. His instinc to find freedom will push him to do things that he never knew he could.
<h3>Dancer in the Dark</h3> 
<p>I have never cried more with a movie than with this one.</p>
